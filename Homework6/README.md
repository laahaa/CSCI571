#Homework 6 
Many days later, as he faced the iOS homework(which is homework 9), Tianming Li was to remember that distant afternoon when his professor took him to discover this homework.
You may think where is homework 5, well, it is eaten by [homework 6](http://cs-server.usc.edu:14187/forecast.php).
Did you laugh by my clumsy joke? You may not, me either, because this homework scared me who is a greenhand a lot.
This is the first time I have written php, used api, parsed json file.

It's not that hard when I finished it, and the reason is probably "php is the best language ……"
As I said, this homework is episode 1, to be continued...
By the way, homework 5 is to configure php and Apache on the server.
