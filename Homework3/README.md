#Homework 3 description
First I should say homework 1 & 2 are ungraded and they are about sign up in piazza and usc cs server.
Here is my homework website, [click it](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~tianming/notFound.html)

In homework3, students are requested to "copy" a page, which means I need to create a page same as the original one.
"Main course" is position, margin or padding of each element, with anchor as side.
[The result page](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~tianming/Homework3.html) is here, enjoy~
